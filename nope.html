    <h2>Here are some facts about homework</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>“Overall, teens (ages 15 to 17) spend an hour a day, on average, doing homework during the school year, up from 44 minutes a day about a decade ago and 30 minutes in the mid-1990s.” </li>
        <li>One Duke University professor recommends homework, believing there is a correlation between homework and academic success for older students. </li>
        <li>“Students in classes that were assigned homework outperformed 69% of students who didn’t have homework on both standardized tests and grades.”</li>
    </ol>
