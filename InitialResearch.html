        School does a terrible job of preparing students for life after high school. One of the main skills that school
        fails to teach is financial literacy. Many students have terrible money management and financial skills and they

            <li>With over 80% of Americans unable to translate a tax form and one in four American student loan
              borrowers in default, there is no doubt that financial literacy is at an all-time low</li>
            <li>Financial jargon is complex and difficult for the average American to fully understand, explains Cindy
              Couyoumjian. This has the effect of intimidating many adults and preventing them from asking critical
              questions about their financial well-being. We are simply taught that we need money to survive and put a
              roof over our heads. It can be too easy at times for the average consumer to feel overwhelmed with
              financial information.</li>
            <li>As a result of the school system’s lack of modernization, experts who teach financial literacy are few
              and far between. Many teachers unfortunately lack the knowledge themselves on financial literacy</li>

            <li>What they want is an investment in their communities and a real chance to make it on their own. And we
              can do our part by supporting neighborhood schools, providing training to teachers and reliable curriculum
              resources, to help the community help itself, not once, but for many years to come.

            <li>As a defined subject area, personal finance is still relatively young and evolving; but research such as
              the meta-analysis recently conducted by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at George
              Washington University and independent research already support the promising effect.

              As an Oakland Unified School District student, I have never had any form of financial literacy-related
              education. I notice the lack of knowledge around all things money whether it be poor spending habits or
              complete disregard for things like the stock market or retirement funds.

              Despite popular belief and the idealized life of professional athletes, most end up filing for bankruptcy
              within a couple years of their careers ending. They often use unsustainable spending habits to fuel their

                    “Being a professional athlete can be extremely rewarding and lucrative. However, a stark 78% of them
                    will go broke after just 3 years of retirement, …. A "big factor," he said, is the significant
                    amount of income they make in a short amount of time.”

                    We can begin by looking at the nature of how athletes earn their money. Athletes typically hit their
                    earnings peak within a few years of finishing school. Across the three major American sports (MLB,
                    NBA, NFL), the average career length is about 4.6 years. Thus, the average athlete’s career is over
                    at a young age, and the typical player is only at their peak earnings for an extremely short period.
                    Most never earn at the same level again. In contrast, the typical American reaches their earnings
                    peak usually decades after finishing school and has accumulated a lifetime of knowledge about how to
                    handle finances by that point. Some athletes may never think about an alternative career path for
                    after retirement. Without formulating a “retirement plan” or proper budget, young athletes blow
                    through their money.

                  <li>
                    Pro athletes who get into financial trouble have a few things in common when it comes to how they
                    lost their fortunes, including having a small earnings window, a lack of financial knowledge, and
                    overspending.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reasons for athletes going broke “Misplaced Trust, Bad Advice, Household Troubles, Great
                    Expectations, Lifestyle Debt, Greed, Vet Envy, Poor Financial Knowledge, and Negligence”

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “Athletes who prioritize material wealth—cars, houses, jewelry, etc. —over financial discipline,
                    strategic investing, and cultivating additional revenue sources tend to have money troubles.”

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On average, NFL players last 3.3 years in the league, while NHL, NBA, and MLB careers last 3.5, 4.8,
                    and 5.6 years, respectively.
