<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

        School does a terrible job of preparing students for life after high school. One of the main skills that school fails to teach is financial literacy. Many students have terrible money management and financial skills and they are forced to learn this the hard way once they live on their own.

            <li>With over 80% of Americans unable to translate a tax form and one in four American student loan borrowers in default, there is no doubt that financial literacy is at an all-time low</li>
            <li>Financial jargon is complex and difficult for the average American to fully understand, explains Cindy Couyoumjian. This has the effect of intimidating many adults and preventing them from asking critical questions about their financial well-being. We are simply taught that we need money to survive and put a roof over our heads. It can be too easy at times for the average consumer to feel overwhelmed with financial information.</li>
            <li>As a result of the school system’s lack of modernization, experts who teach financial literacy are few and far between. Many teachers unfortunately lack the knowledge themselves on financial literacy</li>

            <li>Critics of school-based financial education have argued that teaching kids about money is the parents’ responsibility.</li>
            <li>What they want is an investment in their communities and a real chance to make it on their own. And we can do our part by supporting neighborhood schools, providing training to teachers and reliable curriculum resources, to help the community help itself, not once, but for many years to come.
            </li>
            <li>As a defined subject area, personal finance is still relatively young and evolving; but research such as the meta-analysis recently conducted by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at George Washington University and independent research already support the promising effect.

                As an Oakland Unified School District student, I have never had any form of financial literacy-related education. I notice the lack of knowledge around all things money whether it be poor spending habits or complete disregard for things like the stock market or retirement funds.
