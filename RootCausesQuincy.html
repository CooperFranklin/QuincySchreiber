        Schools and other programs fail to provide effective financial literacy for students. This is difficult because of the complication of the subject but the curriculums that are implemented are ineffective at helping students retain knowlege.

        Over the years, the financial services industry has become more complex. The passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999 deregulated the industry. Individuals were presented with non-conventional lending options such as longer term and interest only loans. New investment options with increasingly obscure derivative products and opt-out retirement plans have made financial decision making more important and difficult to understand.

        Jump$tart surveys (Mandell, 2006) have shown consistently that high school students who play a stock market game are significantly more financially literate than those who do not. This implies that classes which are interactive, relevant, and fun may be more effective than those that are purely didactic.</div>

          This means that the efforts toward financial literacy need to catch especially now as the world keeps getting exponentially more complex. Students must be able to understand how the world is changing and how that should effect their financial decisions. This makes the education process ever more difficult as it is even harder to find people updated with the newest knowledge. 
      </div>
      <div class="col">
          Not only do the teachers need to adjust the curriculum to catch up to the more complex world they also need to make it engaging. Courses like the Jump$tart program were ineffecive in teaching financial literacy because the way that they taught made it difficult to retain the information. Programs need to be interactive so that they are effective.
