        Over the years, the financial services industry has become more complex. The passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999 deregulated the industry. Individuals were presented with non-conventional lending options such as longer term and interest only loans. New investment options with increasingly obscure derivative products and opt-out retirement plans have made financial decision making more important and difficult to understand.

        Jump$tart surveys (Mandell, 2006) have shown consistently that high school students who play a stock market game are significantly more financially literate than those who do not. This implies that classes which are interactive, relevant, and fun may be more effective than those that are purely didactic.</div>

          This means that the efforts toward financial literacy need to catch especially now as the world keeps getting exponentially more complex. Students must be able to understand how the world is changing and how that should effect their financial decisions. This makes the education process ever more difficult as it is even harder to find people updated with the newest knowledge.

          Not only do the teachers need to adjust the curriculum to catch up to the more complex world they also need to make it engaging. Courses like the Jump$tart program were ineffecive in teaching financial literacy because the way that they taught made it difficult to retain the information. Programs need to be interactive so that they are effective.

        Public education prioritizes classes that fall under a more standard common curriculum that requires the teaching of certain subjects. Financial education is not one of these mandatory subjects.

        Lack of financial education in school leads to a vicious poverty cycle that prevents future generations from escaping poverty. Due to the lack of financial education within public schooling, parents are often the main resource children have to learn about personal finances. Poor decision making within adults is often inherited by their children.

        According to GuardianSavings.org, over 120 million American adults practice irresponsible financial decision making, creating a financial illiteracy inheritance cycle. As children absorb their parents habits, they inherit the same flaws their parents have.

        This lack of personal finance education within public schools has a direct correlation with things like credit card debt or even bankruptcy rates as states with required finance coursework scoring much better. The decision making at the state level needs to change. The school system is far behind modern standard as we are being taught the same curriculum as we have been many years ago. We need to modernize and prioritize information that students will use in their real adult lives.

        Without a formidable financial education system, this cycle of iliteracy and irresponsibility will continue. It is up to institutions at state and federal levels to institute change. Smaller organizations lack the audience to make a substantial difference that could help eventually break this financial illiteracy cycle.
