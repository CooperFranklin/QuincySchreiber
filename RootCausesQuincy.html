        Schools and other programs fail to provide effective financial literacy for students. This is difficult because
        of the complication of the subject but the curriculums that are implemented are ineffective at helping students

        Over the years, the financial services industry has become more complex. The passage of the Financial Services
        Modernization Act in 1999 deregulated the industry. Individuals were presented with non-conventional lending
        options such as longer term and interest only loans. New investment options with increasingly obscure derivative
        products and opt-out retirement plans have made financial decision making more important and difficult to
        understand.

        Jump$tart surveys (Mandell, 2006) have shown consistently that high school students who play a stock market game
        are significantly more financially literate than those who do not. This implies that classes which are
        interactive, relevant, and fun may be more effective than those that are purely didactic.</div>

        This means that the efforts toward financial literacy need to catch especially now as the world keeps getting
        exponentially more complex. Students must be able to understand how the world is changing and how that should
        effect their financial decisions. This makes the education process ever more difficult as it is even harder to
        find people updated with the newest knowledge.

      <div class="col">
        Not only do the teachers need to adjust the curriculum to catch up to the more complex world they also need to
        make it engaging. Courses like the Jump$tart program were ineffecive in teaching financial literacy because the
        way that they taught made it difficult to retain the information. Programs need to be interactive so that they
        are effective.

        Lack of financial education in school leads to a vicious poverty cycle that prevents future generations from
        escaping poverty. Due to the lack of financial education within public schooling, parents are often the main
        resource children have to learn about personal finances. Poor decision making within adults is often inherited
        by their children.

        According to GuardianSavings.org, over 120 million American adults practice irresponsible financial decision
        making, creating a financial illiteracy inheritance cycle. As children absorb their parents habits, they inherit

          This lack of personal finance education within public schools has a direct correlation with things like credit
          card debt or even bankruptcy rates as states with required finance coursework scoring much better. The
          decision making at the state level needs to change. The school system is far behind modern standard as we are
          being taught the same curriculum as we have been many years ago. We need to modernize and prioritize
          information that students will use in their real adult lives.

          Without a formidable financial education system, this cycle of iliteracy and irresponsibility will continue.
          It is up to institutions at state and federal levels to institute change. Smaller organizations lack the
          audience to make a substantial difference that could help eventually break this financial illiteracy cycle.

          In the end the majority of financial shortcomings for athletes come from a lack of education. They are handed
          large contracts, but don’t understand how much they really have because the arbitrary number put in front of
          them is the largest they have ever handled so they believe it is almost boundless. In reality it is not and
          will run out rather quickly once it is not coming into their pockets at a consistent rate. The amount of money
          they receive is still considerable and if handled properly can lead them to long term financial wealth. All
          these athletes need is proper education.

        <div class="col">
          For athletes to stay wealthy after their careers are over they need to learn from the mistakes of their
          predecessors. The bulk of this entails responsible spending during and after their professional sports careers
          are over and finding alternative revenue streams for when their contracts expire.
