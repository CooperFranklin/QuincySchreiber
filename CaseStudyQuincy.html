  Summary
  In 2018, an undergraduate student at Duke University sat through a particularly boring financial wellness seminar. The student knew the information was important, but he simply couldn't connect with the presentation. And he wasn't alone. Most of his classmates were on their phones throughout the entire seminar. Surely, he thought, there must be a better way.
  The student's name was Bolun Li. He recruited his friends, Simran and Simon, to help solve the problem of how to make financial education fun and engaging for young adults. While thinking back to the seminar, a solution occurred to them. Why not meet their peers where they already are â€” on their phones.
  In the years since Zogo's founding, we've expanded our product offerings, grown our team, and kept it weird by moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas. Our award-winning suite of products offers bite-size learning modules and tangible incentives that have changed the way people learn. We partner with financial institutions, fintechs, schools, and more to make education simple, fun, and accessible for all.
  
  Positive impact
  It helps teach financial literacy in an interesting and fun way so that students better retain the knowledge that they are taught
  
  Limitations / negative impact
  They do a lot of advertising on social media and that can be difficult
  The college students dont necessarily have the most knowledge on financial literacy as a whole
