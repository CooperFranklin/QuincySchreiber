            The most effective strategies to teach financial literacy effectively is to create an interactive and entertaining curriculum. This encourages the retention of information and also creates a more enjoyable experience. With an experience that's enjoyable it keeps people coming back and encourages new students to start learning. Without these two main pillars of teaching financial literacy it is very hard to create a curriculum that is effective.

            In 2018 a student at Duke university realized the retention of the fancial wellness seminar he was attending. He saw that everyone was on their phone and that nobody could really connect or enjoy the presentation. Zogo was created to make a better way to teach financial literacy. With his friends Simran and Simon they created zogo, a fun and engaging way to teach financial literacy to young adults. Since people were alwasy on their phones they thought why not make an app. After expanding, improving and winning many awards we get the Zogo that we have today.

They provide financial education training to teachers and workshops for students. BAFEF believes that all young people should have access to financial education as knowledge at a young age benefits students greatly in adulthood. BAFEF was created by Ted Joblanksi and Bob Thompson in 2007 as a charitable organization to help bay area children. Since 2007, the company has grown to include volunteer run committees to operate the nonprofit without their own desire for financial gain obstructing the work they are trying to do. As a nonprofit, BAFEF resorts to fundraisers to raise money for the work they do. They charity events such as an annual wine tasting to raise money for the organization."

            BAFEF helps provide the much needed financial literacy education that so many young people lack. They provide opportunities for teachers to learn to better teach students while also working directly with students to teach important information. Sadly, this company is only in Northern California. They do not provide assistance to others around the state, country and world. An online database of information could help the company branch out and provide education for many more students in different places.
